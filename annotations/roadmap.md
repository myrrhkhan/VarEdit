## Adding Environment Variables

### Backend:

- Make an outer function to input environment variable and add -> string status
	- Function to check if already there (to prevent duplicates)
	- Function to check OS
	- Mac/Linux:
		- Helper function to check for config files
		- Function to make directory and config files if they don't exist
	- Check for settings file and give error if not and return "set a thing"
	- Set the thingy

### What to do when add env var is called

- Check if settings file exists
	- If settinge file does not exist
		- return "file does not exist" error
		- Redirect to settings page and prompt user to set everything
	- Check if setting for bash file exists
		- if yes, set the variable
		- if not, go to settings menu
If cannot make file, don't crash but send a separate error message that gives a bigger alert
